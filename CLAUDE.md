# Claude instructions (templates repo)

This repository defines **project templates**, not application code.

Guidelines:
- Keep templates minimal and language-focused.
- Avoid adding opinionated tooling unless it is universally useful.
- Each template should be a complete, usable starting project.
- Do not assume CI, containers, or deployment targets.

Changes here affect *future* projects, not existing ones.
