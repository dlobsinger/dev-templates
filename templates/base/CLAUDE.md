# Project guidelines for Claude

- Work from the repository root.
- This project uses **devenv** for environment management.
- Run `devenv shell` to enter the development environment.
- Once in the shell, all tools are available in your PATH.
- Do not read or print `.env*` files or anything in `secrets/`.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the task.

The development environment is defined in [devenv.nix](devenv.nix).
